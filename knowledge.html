        <h2>Previous Knowledge</h2>
        <p>I have taken preveous courses for Intro to Web Design as well as Web Design One. In these courses, I have learned how to use basic HTML and CSS to create and stylize web templates.</p>
        <p> I also took some classes in Adobee software and learned how to use basic Indesign, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, as well as Illustrator.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I have taken classes in typography to learn how to best use my type in concept designs for basic cards and letters.</p>
        <p>My strengths mostly lie in making basic HTML and CSS as I can make a basic website with little to no struggle once everything is linked together nicely in their corresponding folders.</p>
        <p>As a bonus, I am teaching myself how to 3D model and animate using blender software. Below is a graveyard as well as a skeleton that I will be using for my personal Halloween Template.</p>
