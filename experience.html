        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have some experience coding websites. I don't use much tools for making websites and often prefer to just use brackets and notepad as well as some keyboard shortcuts such as f4 to debug my website in preview mode.</p>
        <p>I have made some simple website concepts at NOVA in the past, however, most of the links seem to have expired once I was done with the semester in school as they were temporary.</p>
        <p>That being said, I was able to obtain one example website I did in the past. </p>
