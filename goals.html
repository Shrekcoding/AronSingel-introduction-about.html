        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals in this class are to get a better understanding of some of the HTML and CSS properties that were not discussed in ITD 110.</p>
        <p> The only confusing part I can think of is how to apply propper padding to websites as that is something I sometimes struggle on when spacing dividers and images on websites, so it would be nice to go over that.</p>
        <p>I think an important thing to cover especially in the beginning of the year is proper folder setup. Although the setup process is often times brief, it is crucial to website designing. </p>
